	<h3>Part I: The General Information</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	This section mainly goes over methods and ideas that apply to all school, not just online.
	That being said, many of the techniques and practices will be given through the <i>lense</i>
	of online school. I'm not an expert, this is a collection of ideas I've osmosis'd after
	trying to pass during all this.

	<h4>Class Checklist</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Notebook</li>
		<li>Folder</li>
		<li>Anki Deck</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Cultivate a Work Environment</h4>

	<h4>Common Mistakes</h4>
	<i>1. Trying to get through a whole lecture in one sitting</i><br>
	Many of these videos are not made with the student in mind. Being between 30 minutes to an hour in
	length, being able to use them effectively is crucial. They're often badly made, riddled with
	technical and other errors, and generally miss the point of a lecture and seek solely to introduce
	content.
	<br><br>
	If the lectures are recorded, try watching them in 30 minute chunks. If they're live, do your best
	to treat them like a normal lecture by turning off your phone and directing your attention solely
	towards the lecturer. Make sure to voice your concerns immediately and without hesitation. You're
	paying too much to be there, they can handle critisism.<br><br>

	<i>2. Not Taking Notes/Studying</i><br><br>

	<i>3. Cheating</i><br><br>

	<h4>How to Organize Your Day With Online Classes</h4>

	<h4>What to Do With Downtime</h4>
	<p>
		One of the unspoken <i>(unspoken by professors and universities, students talk about this all the time)</i>
		is that with online school, comes a different and at times more difficult catagory of work.
	</p>

	<h4>Other Tips</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Learn how to use your class/homework platform(s) inside and out. There's often hidden features like 
			built-in calendars, email notifications, assignment lists for the semester, and others that can really
			help you stay organized.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Part II: The Secret Tricks You Came Here for</h3>
	<h4>Introduction</h4>
	<h4>Get a better alarm</h4>
	Your alarm probably sucks. The stock iphone alarm has barely any customization and is overall
	lacking in any modern features. This is easily demonstrated. Get someone else to play your alarm.
	<i>I bet you feel terrible</i>. Now imagine how that affects your mental state every morning.<br><br>

	Get something like <i>Alarmy</i> on IOS and set the alarm to <b>Random</b>. You'd be amazed how
	big of a difference changing your alarm dynamic can make.
